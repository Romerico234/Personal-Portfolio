        "description": "Towson Academic Pathway (TAP) is a web application designed to simplify academic planning for Towson University students. It is built with React on the frontend and MongoDB and Express on the backend. TAP leverages AI to generate personalized degree plans. Key features include a drag-and-drop interface for organizing degree plans, an integrated course catalog for browsing and adding courses, a dedicated page for viewing Towson University requirements, and more. TAP provides an intuitive, efficient, and stress-free solution to the challenges of manual academic planning. Possibly big things coming from this project ðŸ‘€.",
